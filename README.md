# LUPE 2.0 Analysis Package

This package provides the core LUPE analysis pipeline for behavior analysis in Jupyter Notebooks.  
It serves as a resource to run pose-based behavioral classification and downstream analysis with minimal setup.  

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** If you would like to use LUPE with a graphical interface instead of coding, check out the [LUPE 2.0 App](https://github.com/justin05423/LUPE-2.0-App).  
This companion Streamlit application requires minimal coding experience and allows you to run LUPE through an interactive interface.

# System Requirements
LUPE-2.0 Analysis Package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the coding notebooks. 

DeepLabCut<sup>1,2</sup> and A-SOiD<sup>3</sup> used to create LUPE-2.0 model for pose estimation and behavior classification, respectively. Refer to GitHub of [DLC](https://github.com/DeepLabCut) or [A-SOiD](https://github.com/YttriLab/A-SOID) for further details. 

#### OS Requirements
- This package is supported for *Windows* and *Mac* but can be run on *Linux* computers given additional installation of require packages.

#### Python Dependencies
- For dependencies please refer to the requirements.txt file. Note that the model is created and tested on Python version 3.11.

# Installation Guide
#### Download the LUPE 2.0 A-SOiD Model [HERE](https://upenn.box.com/s/9rfslrvcc7m6fji8bmgktnegghyu88b0) and move the contents of the folder into this 'Model' folder.
> **Note**: Find the LUPE 2.0 DLC Model [HERE](https://upenn.box.com/s/av3i14c64rj6zls9lz6pda0it5b5q7f3) for analyzing pose estimation for LUPE video data.

#### Access the analysis scripts: In a Virutal Environment IDE
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
#### Access the analysis scripts: If no local IDE (not preferred)
```commandline
jupyter lab
```
#### See [README-Analysis](https://github.com/justin05423/LUPE-2.0-AnalysisPackage/blob/main/manuscript_acc_2025/README-Analysis.md) for instructions to run and reproduce some of the analyses from the  [PRE-PRINT manuscript](https://github.com/justin05423/LUPE-2.0-AnalysisPackage/tree/main/manuscript_acc_2025)<sup>4</sup> data.
